Simple and lightweight calculator and plotting tool

@chapter Overview

This is simple calculator that is capable of doing basic mathematical operations (add, multiple numbers and etc.)
and calculating functions such as sin, cos, exp and etc.
The calculator can be run in 3 modes.

@section Basic calc

Basic calculator is capable of counting algebraic expressions
with multiple operations, functions, brackets and etc.
You enter expression and then press "equal" button (=) to see the result.
Maximal length of expression is 255 symbols.

If expression contains errors (ex. sin5, ((x+1), 3-+-4 and etc.) it tries to complete or
interpret expression so it would have any mathematical sense. If error cannot be fixed, error message will be output 
to expression input textbox. Thus said:

@itemize
@item
Any missed multiplication symbol will be added as if it would be scientific notation, ex. sin(2x)cos(x) will bee evaluated as sin(2*x)*cos(x)

@item
Any function that has no brackets will implicitly capture all tokens after it until operator or function met, ex. sin2xcos2x evaluates to sin(2*x)*cos(x)

@item
All unclosed brackets will be closed automatically in the end, ex. sin(x)*(+(1 + 3)*(1 + cos(x) will be evaluated as sin(x)*(+(1 + 3)*(1 + cos(x)))

@item
Any closing bracket that was not opened will be skipped, ex. sin(x)+))))))1 evaluates as sin(x) + 1

@item
Partial decimal numbers and numbers in scientific notation are proccessed normally, ex .32 evaluates to 0.32 and 1.6e2 evaluates to 160

@end itemize

Error list:
@itemize
@item
Invalid numbers in expression, ex. 3.33.33, (.), e23 and etc.

@item
Mismatched operator or function, ex. (*2), sin*2, (2+), (3+cos) and etc.

@item
Expression seems to be unfinshed, ex. sinx+cosx+3-, ) and etc.

@item
Expression has unknown function, ex. qqrt(3), si2x and etc.

@end itemize

Examples:

@itemize
@item
7 + 44 (=) 51

@item
sin(1+2) (=) 0.1411200

@item
exp(3)/2/3.141 (=) 3.1973156
@end itemize

Calculation precision is 7 decimal places. If the result is too small/large then
it is converted to normalized science notation (ex. 3.14e-8).

Calculator also supports using "x" as substitution argument. If expression
contains "x" in itself, then user must specify its value in textbox (default value of x = 0).
This value will be substituted to expression and it will be calculated as normal one.

@section Plot calculator

If expression contains argument (x) in it, then calculator can be run in plot mode.
It will plot the function represented by input expression and output its graph
in designated window. It will calculate 255 values between given range (default [-5, 5]) and domain of
function will be determined by its values. Function input obeys same rules as basic expression input.
